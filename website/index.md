<p style="text-align: justify;">Assalam o Alaikum!
                                <br>My name is Mian Hasnain Ali, a student of BS(SE) and interested in business since my early days of life. A few months ago, when my parents were worried about our higher education, due to poor financial conditions then I gave the idea of building a shop to meet our financial needs. being the best business idea, it proved beneficial and was praised by my parents later. Our shop contains a moderate range of grocery products at the village level and just opened for a few hours in the evening because my father is a Businessman. The purpose of telling all this to you is to show my business thinking.<br>
             <br>At present, a major part of our income is utilized in paying educational expenses especially in paying hostel dues for me and my brother.<br>
             <br>Considering the current situation of job opportunities in Pakistan it is very hard to find a job that fulfills needs even being on merit. The thing which matters also is the institute of degree completion. The hiring rate of students of highly ranked universities is much better than compared of other universities. No doubt COMSAT is no 1 university, and the dream of millions of students like me.<br>
<br>The other aspect is, that it is not affordable for the poor or low middle-class the category in which I consider myself. if students like me are given some financial assistance, then it will be a great opportunity for them to get an education from the best university. I am a bona fide student and a hard worker also. I got 433/500 in grade 5, 457/500 in grade 8 in the PEC examination.<br>
<br>Keeping my financial background, my hard work in mind, and being hopeful for a bright future after studying at COMSATS I think I am eligible for a NOP scholarship, and I should give myself this chance. I submit the following facts for your kind consideration regarding my eligibility and hope for the best.<br>
<br>Salam!<br>
